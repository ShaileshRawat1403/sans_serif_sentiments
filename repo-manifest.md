# 🗂️ Repository Manifest

This document serves as the **modular index** for the Sans Serif Sentiments system.

Each repository listed below is independently maintained, yet structurally connected by a shared philosophy:  
**clarity, cognitive usability, and content that survives automation**.

Use this manifest to explore, fork, or contribute to any module of the system.
