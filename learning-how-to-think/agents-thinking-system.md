🧠 Code Breakdown (Aligned With Your Thinking Loop)

Function	What It Does	Concept Covered

perceive()	Classifies the input into categories like draft, task, or escalation	Perception step — maps real-world language into system-understood labels
reason()	Decides what action to take, along with a confidence score	Reasoning step — links perception to action, weighted by likelihood
reflect()	Checks if the reasoning was confident enough to proceed	Reflection step — adds self-awareness and fallback logic
act()	Executes the decision or pauses for human review	Action step — carries out or escalates based on reflection
run()	Ties it all together into one agentic loop	Full Perceive → Reason → Reflect → Act loop

🧪 Example Usage

system = ThinkingAgentSystem()

print(system.run("We need to fix this urgently."))
# 🚨 Escalated: 'We need to fix this urgently.'

print(system.run("Here's a new idea for the onboarding flow."))
# 📝 Draft created: 'Here's a new idea for the onboarding flow.'

print(system.run("Book the meeting room for Friday."))
# ✅ Task added to queue: 'Book the meeting room for Friday.'

print(system.run("Maybe."))
# 🛑 Holding input for human review: 'Maybe.'

📍 Why This Example Matters

It reflects every chapter from classification and perception → reasoning clarity → reflective checkpoints → action with traceability.

It is modular, testable, and cognitively explainable — not just functional.

It’s scalable — you can add memory persistence, multi-agent routing, or human-in-the-loop override easily.
