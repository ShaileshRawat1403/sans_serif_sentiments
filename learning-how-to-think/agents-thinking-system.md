🧠 thinking_system.py — Explained in Human Language

This file simulates how a real thinking agent system might behave. It’s built like a person trained to:

1. Understand what’s being said


2. Decide what to do


3. Think twice if unsure


4. Take action — or pause


---

🧩 Structure of the Agent System

class ThinkingAgentSystem:

We define a system — like a virtual teammate — that follows a thinking process every time it receives an input.


---

1. perceive(input_data)

def perceive(self, input_data):

> “What am I being told?”



This function reads the input and tries to label it based on keywords:

If it sees "urgent" → treat it as something serious (escalation)

If it sees "idea" → it's a draft to explore

Otherwise → it’s probably a task


📦 Example:

perceive("This is urgent")
# → {'type': 'escalation', 'content': 'This is urgent'}


---

2. reason(perception)

def reason(self, perception):

> “Based on the type, what should I do?”



It maps labels into actions, each with a confidence score:

Type	Action	Confidence

escalation	alert someone	0.9
draft	create draft	0.8
task	queue it	0.7
unknown	hold it	0.4


📦 Example:

reason({"type": "draft", "content": "New idea"})
# → {'action': 'create_draft', 'confidence': 0.8}


---

3. reflect(decision)

def reflect(self, decision):

> “Am I confident enough to act?”



This is the gut check.
If confidence is below 0.6, it flags the decision for human review.

📦 Example:

reflect({'action': 'hold', 'confidence': 0.4})
# → {'status': 'review_needed', 'reason': 'Low confidence'}


---

4. act(reflection, perception)

def act(self, reflection, perception):

> “Now, what should I actually do?”



If it’s flagged for review → don’t take action

Else → take the approved action, and log it in memory


The output is a human-readable message.

📦 Example:

act({'status': 'approved', 'action': 'alert'}, {'content': 'Fix urgently'})
# → "🚨 Escalated: 'Fix urgently'"


---

5. run(input_data)

def run(self, input_data):

> The thinking loop in action:
Perceive → Reason → Reflect → Act



This is how a thinking agent processes any input end-to-end.

📦 Example:

system = ThinkingAgentSystem()
system.run("Here's an urgent idea.")
# Output: 🚨 Escalated: 'Here's an urgent idea.'

🧠 Why This Design Works

This agent:

Ability	How It’s Done

Understands context	via perceive()
Applies rules + judgement	via reason()
Includes a sanity check	via reflect()
Avoids blind automation	via human review condition
Logs memory for traceability	via self.memory.append()



---

💬 Real-world Example Usage

Here’s what your terminal or app might return:

ThinkingAgentSystem().run("Book the venue for tomorrow.")
# ✅ Task added to queue: 'Book the venue for tomorrow.'

ThinkingAgentSystem().run("Maybe?")
# 🛑 Holding input for human review: 'Maybe?'

🛠 How This Aligns With Our Series

Chapter Concept	Reflected in Code

Perception matters	perceive()
Reasoning is a loop	reason()
Don’t act blindly	reflect()
Keep thinking trace	memory.append()
Agency needs guardrails	confidence logic
