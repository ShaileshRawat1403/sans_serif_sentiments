# Learning How to Think (In the Age of AI)

## ðŸ§­ Overview
A modular, markdown-first series designed to help you **think better before you build AI systems**.  
This isn't just about agents or prompts. It's about structured thought.  
Because the next generation of AI won't replace your brain â€” it'll reflect your thinking.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To help developers, strategists, writers, and curious minds:
- Understand **thinking as a system**
- Build **better AI workflows** grounded in clarity
- Avoid automating **confusion, bias, or noise**

## ðŸ§  Philosophy
We believe:
> Tools donâ€™t think. People do.  
> But AI reflects how you think.  
> So letâ€™s make that thinking scalable, reliable, and intentional.

Each chapter uses the **FnF framework**:  
**Friction â†’ Bridge â†’ Evidence â†’ Implication â†’ Action â†’ Look Ahead**
