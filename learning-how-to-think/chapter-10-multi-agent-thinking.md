# Learning How to Think (In the Age of AI)

## Chapter 10: Multi-Agent Thinking = Collaborative Thinking

### Friction

Most agent systems fall apart when you add more than one agent.  
Why?

> Because multi-agent systems aren’t just code — they’re **collaborative thought loops**.

People assume more agents = more power.  
But in reality:
- The logic breaks  
- Tasks get dropped  
- Context gets lost  
- Decisions get duplicated

This is the same reason **teams fail** in real life:
> No role clarity. No clean handoffs. No shared memory.

---

### Bridge

Let’s align the analogy:

| Human Team              | Multi-Agent System                       |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Team roles              | Specialized agents                       |
| Task ownership          | Agent responsibility scopes              |
| Hand-offs & meetings    | Task outputs passed as next inputs       |
| Status updates          | Memory/state logs shared across agents   |
| Decision-makers         | Final executor or output handler         |

To build good multi-agent systems, you must:
- Define what each agent **knows**  
- Define what each agent **owns**  
- Define how they **talk to each other**  
- Define how they **share memory and control**

### Evidence

Failure Patterns in Multi-Agent Systems:

| Pattern                        | Root Cause                                         |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Agents overwrite each other   | No memory sharing or last-step awareness          |
| Conflicting decisions         | Undefined authority hierarchy                     |
| Infinite loops                | Circular task handoffs without escape clause      |
| Repetition                    | No task deduplication or output logging           |
| Incomplete outputs            | No single point of resolution or success trigger  |

These are not coding errors.  
They’re **collaboration failures**.

---

### Implication

If you treat agents like isolated bots:
- You’ll duplicate work  
- You’ll lose context  
- You’ll confuse your system

But if you design agents like team members:
- With defined inputs  
- Clear roles  
- Trust boundaries  
- Escalation logic

You’ll build systems that are **scalable and stable**.

### Action

Use this **Multi-Agent Role Canvas** before you build anything collaborative:

```markdown
## Multi-Agent Role Canvas

- [ ] What does this agent observe? (Perception scope)
- [ ] What does this agent own? (Decision rights)
- [ ] What does it pass to others? (Output / next step)
- [ ] Who takes over after it? (Next actor or role)
- [ ] What memory does it need access to? (Shared or local)
- [ ] How does it handle failure or doubt? (Fallbacks / escalation)
```

Try this:

1. Take a workflow you currently do manually in a team (e.g., writing, reviewing, publishing).


2. Break it into stages.


3. Assign an agent to each stage.


4. Define what the agent receives, does, and hands off.


5. Add a final agent or function that integrates and validates the output.

#### Bonus: Simple Multi-Agent Collaboration in Code

```python
def agent_writer(context):
    draft = f\"Drafted: {context['topic']}\"
    return {'draft': draft, 'author': 'writer'}

def agent_editor(context):
    if 'draft' not in context:
        return \"No draft to edit.\"
    edited = context['draft'].replace('Drafted', 'Edited')
    return {'final': edited, 'editor': 'editor'}
```

🧠 Line-by-line Breakdown:

```python
def agent_writer(context):
    draft = f"Drafted: {context['topic']}"
```

> First agent receives a topic and creates a draft.


```python
return {'draft': draft, 'author': 'writer'}
`

> It outputs a labeled draft with attribution — this simulates a handoff.


```python
def agent_editor(context):
    if 'draft' not in context:
        return "No draft to edit."
```

> Second agent checks if a draft was passed to it — fails gracefully if not.


```python
edited = context['draft'].replace('Drafted', 'Edited')
return {'final': edited, 'editor': 'editor'}
```

> Modifies and hands off again — clean, traceable handoff.



> This isn’t just clean code.

> It’s cooperative cognition — the foundation of reliable agent networks.

### Look Ahead

In the next chapter:

> “Reflection as a Feature, Not a Flaw”



We'll stop treating reflection as error correction — and start building it in by design.
Reflection is how both humans and agents learn.

> Let’s embed reflection into loops — not just postmortems.
