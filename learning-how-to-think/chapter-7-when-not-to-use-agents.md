# Learning How to Think (In the Age of AI)

## Chapter 7: When Not to Use AI Agents

### Friction

In the race to automate everything, one truth is often ignored:

> **Some loops should never be automated.**

Just because you *can* build an agent…  
Doesn’t mean you *should*.

Agents are built to follow logic.  
But many decisions rely on:
- Nuance
- Ambiguity
- Emotional intelligence
- Ethical weight
- Human timing

And when you hand those off to automation?  
You don’t free up time.  
You just **outsource risk**.

---

### Bridge

Agents excel when:
- The input is structured  
- The outcomes are measurable  
- The logic is stable  
- The feedback loop is clear

But agents break when:
- The task needs deep context  
- Tradeoffs are implicit  
- Stakeholders shift  
- Consequences are reputational or ethical

You can’t design an agent for:
> “How should I handle this team conflict?”  
> “Should I pivot our product strategy?”  
> “Do I trust this partnership?”

That’s not automation.  
That’s **human judgment**.

### Evidence

Let’s compare:

| Use Case                          | Good for Agents? | Why / Why Not?                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Summarizing policy documents     | ✅ Yes           | Structured input + predictable output          |
| Drafting a feature release note  | ✅ Yes           | Defined scope, repeatable logic                |
| Deciding team bonuses            | ❌ No            | Subjective, emotional, reputational risk       |
| Conflict resolution messages     | ❌ No            | High stakes, nuance, shifting dynamics         |
| Writing help desk FAQs           | ✅ Yes           | Factual, repeatable, easy to test              |
| Approving vendor negotiations    | ⚠️ Mixed         | Depends on context, authority, ethics involved |

Automation should follow a **judgment filter** — not replace it.

---

### Implication

Over-automation has a cost:

- You lose awareness of edge cases.  
- You blindfold nuance with logic.  
- You degrade human trust in outcomes.

> The goal is not full automation.  
> It’s **intentional delegation**.

Let agents take over *what’s defined*.  
Let humans lead *what’s still being discovered*.

---

### Action

Use this **Automation Fit Test** before building any agent:

```markdown
## Automation Fit Heuristic

- [ ] Is the task highly repeatable?
- [ ] Can the input be structured or parsed easily?
- [ ] Is the outcome measurable or testable?
- [ ] Are the consequences reversible or low-stakes?
- [ ] Is human emotion or ethics involved?
```

✅ 4–5 Yes = Agent is likely safe and useful  
⚠️ 2–3 Yes = Agent may need human review  
❌ 0–1 Yes = Don’t automate. Use human judgment

Try this:

1. Pick one current workflow or task you're thinking of automating.


2. Run it through the checklist.


3. Identify which step(s) might cause unintended harm or confusion.


4. Reframe: What parts can be supported by AI, but not fully replaced?

Bonus: Simple Guard Clause in Code

```python
def is_agent_suitable(task):
    if task['stakes'] == 'high' or task['emotional'] == True:
        return False
    if task['structured'] and task['repeatable']:
        return True
    return False
```python

🧠 Explanation:

if task['stakes'] == 'high' or task['emotional'] == True:

> If the task involves emotional weight or high consequences → Don't automate



if task['structured'] and task['repeatable']:

> If the task is clear and consistent → Safe to automate



return False

> Otherwise, better to pause or review manually.



Use logic as a filter, not a shortcut.

Look Ahead

In the next chapter:

> “Agentic Failure = Friction in Flow”



We’ll dissect what actually causes agents to break.
Spoiler: It’s not the tool — it’s the mismatch between your loop and your logic.

> Let’s debug agent design the way we debug code: by finding the friction.

We’ll go deep into real-world failure points — and how to design around them.
