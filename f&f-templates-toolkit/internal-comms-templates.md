# Internal Communication Templates Using the Flavor & Function Framework  
*Turn messages into movements — with structure, empathy, and clarity.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

These templates are designed for high-stakes internal communication scenarios — whether you're rolling out a change, addressing confusion, or reinforcing clarity.

Built on the **Flavor & Function** 6-stage model:

- **Friction** – What’s causing dissonance internally?  
- **Bridge** – What needs reframing?  
- **Evidence** – What proof or clarity can we offer?  
- **Implication** – What’s at stake if misunderstood?  
- **Action** – What do we want the reader/team to do?  
- **Look Ahead** – What reassurance or roadmap can we provide?

Use these templates to pre-brief AI or plan your message drafts in structured clarity.

## 🧰 Template 1: Communicating a System Downtime

**Use When:** You’re announcing planned or emergency downtime for internal tools/systems.

```
You are a communications lead writing an internal update about a system downtime.

Friction → Teams will lose access to [system name] during [time].  
Bridge → It’s not a bug or failure — it’s part of our upgrade plan.  
Evidence → This maintenance helps us fix [x issues] and improve [y performance].  
Implication → We expect [impact], so plan for [alternative].  
Action → Include link to backup instructions or point of contact.  
Look Ahead → Mention when normal use resumes + reassurance of data integrity.
```

---

### ✅ Example 1

```
You are writing a Teams post about upcoming downtime for the HR portal.

Friction → The HR portal will be inaccessible from Friday 7 PM to Saturday 2 AM.  
Bridge → This isn’t unexpected — it's a part of scheduled security updates.  
Evidence → The upgrade addresses recent ticket delays and improves login performance.  
Implication → Employees won’t be able to download payslips during this window.  
Action → Link to FAQ and flag the support Slack channel for urgent needs.  
Look Ahead → Normal access resumes Saturday morning. No data will be lost.
```

---

## 🧰 Template 2: Explaining a Policy Change

**Use When:** You need to communicate a shift in internal policy and avoid backlash or confusion.

```
You are a communications manager helping teams understand a policy shift.

Friction → The new [policy/tool/process] may feel abrupt or unclear.  
Bridge → It’s not just a rule — it’s tied to [company need/compliance/customer promise].  
Evidence → Previous [incidents/data/feedback] showed [why it matters].  
Implication → Not following this creates risks for [team/process/customer].  
Action → Clarify what changes, and what doesn’t — link to detailed policy.  
Look Ahead → Invite questions and explain when/how a review will happen.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2

```
You are sending a company-wide email about updated remote work rules.

Friction → Starting next month, we’ll move to a 3-day office hybrid policy.  
Bridge → This isn’t a rollback — it’s a rhythm recalibration based on team dynamics.  
Evidence → Surveys showed 60% wanted structured in-office collaboration days.  
Implication → Teams without sync days faced slower onboarding and higher attrition.  
Action → Clarify which days are team-led, which are flexible, and link to policy doc.  
Look Ahead → Feedback is open for 60 days, and we’ll review again in Q1.
```

---

## 🧰 Template 3: Reinforcing Team Priorities

**Use When:** You’re aligning cross-functional teams around shifting goals or focus.

```
You are a project owner sending an internal recap to re-align priorities.

Friction → Multiple priorities have blurred focus across [teams].  
Bridge → This isn’t about scope creep — it’s about realigning for impact.  
Evidence → Data shows [x] projects are delayed due to unclear handoffs.  
Implication → Without realignment, effort is lost in duplication or blocked dependencies.  
Action → Share the updated priority list and call out what’s paused or moved.  
Look Ahead → Weekly check-ins will now include alignment nudges.
```

---

### ✅ Example 3

```
You are writing a Notion update to the Growth + Product teams.

Friction → Growth and Product have been chasing similar KPIs in silos.  
Bridge → This isn’t duplication — it’s opportunity lost in parallel paths.  
Evidence → Both teams ran near-identical experiments last month without visibility.  
Implication → Without coordination, we risk customer fatigue and unclear data attribution.  
Action → From now, we’ll use a shared experiment tracker (linked).  
Look Ahead → Monthly retro includes shared roadmap view and joint OKR planning.
```

## 🚧 Common Blockers in Internal Comms (With Fixes)

| Communication Breakdown | Why It Happens                                                      | Fix It With Flavor & Function                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Generic Messaging     | Doesn’t feel relevant to the audience                               | Add **Friction** with specific pain points (“what this means for your role”) |
| ❌ Overly Defensive      | Sounds corporate, not human                                         | Use **Bridge** to show *why* without sounding like justification          |
| ❌ No Takeaway Action    | Reader is unclear what to do next                                   | Ensure **Action** is specific and includes support links or guides        |
| ❌ Dry Announcements     | No emotional tone, no forward direction                             | Use **Look Ahead** to anchor hope, clarity, or what’s improving next      |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

Use these templates to:

- Defuse confusion without sounding defensive  
- Add context, direction, and psychological safety  
- Move from *announcing* to *aligning*

This is how systems think — and humans follow.
