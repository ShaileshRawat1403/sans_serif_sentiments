# AI-Assisted Messaging Patterns Using the Flavor & Function Framework  
*Just because AI can draft it doesn’t mean it should.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

AI can help you draft faster — but speed is not strategy.  
This guide shows how to use AI for **thinking clarity**, not just output velocity.  
It builds on the Flavor & Function loop, so messages remain clear, credible, and human.

Loop:  
- **Friction** – What complexity are we untangling?  
- **Bridge** – What thinking gap is AI helping close?  
- **Evidence** – How does AI assist without replacing human insight?  
- **Implication** – What goes wrong when AI is used blindly?  
- **Action** – How do you guide AI or co-write with it?  
- **Look Ahead** – What should the team verify, iterate, or reflect on?

## 🧰 Template 1: Co-Writing a Change Announcement with AI

**Use When:** Drafting a first version with AI but needing human tone and clarity.

```
You are writing a change comms note and want to use AI for structure, not soul.

Friction → You need to explain something complex with clarity and empathy.  
Bridge → AI helps draft faster, but final tone is refined by you.  
Evidence → The AI-generated draft offers structure, but lacks stakeholder nuance.  
Implication → Sending it as-is may trigger confusion or misinterpretation.  
Action → Use AI to create a skeletal version. Edit key parts: intro, bridge, CTA.  
Look Ahead → Share feedback on how AI drafting helped or missed the mark.
```

---

### ✅ Example 1

```
You are announcing a change in performance review format.

Friction → Past reviews felt like surprises or scorekeeping.  
Bridge → This change moves us toward feedback-as-growth.  
Evidence → AI-generated email helped list key bullets quickly.  
Implication → But without context, it read like a cold policy update.  
Action → You rewrote the opening + added team-specific outcomes.  
Look Ahead → Ask managers to share this using their own voice, not forward the AI text.
```

---

## 🧰 Template 2: Using AI to Rewrite for Audience Clarity

**Use When:** A technical update needs to be made user-friendly.

```
You are using AI to simplify or reframe dense info for a broader audience.

Friction → Engineering docs or legal copy is hard for teams to digest.  
Bridge → AI can help rephrase, but needs accurate grounding.  
Evidence → Without prompt clarity, AI may oversimplify or hallucinate.  
Implication → Misinformed simplification leads to bad decisions.  
Action → Use layered prompting. First: Simplify without dumbing down. Then: Validate facts.  
Look Ahead → Add a human sign-off step before distribution.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2

```
You are rewriting a data policy update for all employees.

Friction → Original copy is 900 words of legal and security terms.  
Bridge → AI is used to identify structure, not to invent meaning.  
Evidence → It helped chunk content into “What changed / Why / Impact” format.  
Implication → But one section introduced inaccurate wording around user consent.  
Action → Manually rewrote that part and included proper legal review.  
Look Ahead → Feedback survey will test understanding of this change.
```

## 🧰 Template 3: Prompting AI to Reframe Tone (Empathy, Urgency, Calm)

**Use When:** The message is technically right, but emotionally off.

```
You are using AI to reframe tone — not facts — for a sensitive message.

Friction → The current message feels robotic or sharp.  
Bridge → AI can model emotional cues, but must be nudged.  
Evidence → It helped soften transitions and rephrase hard lines.  
Implication → Without human review, tone may still feel performative.  
Action → Prompt AI: “Rewrite with calm authority + reader-first perspective.”  
Look Ahead → Check final draft with 2 humans: 1 internal, 1 external if possible.
```

---

### ✅ Example 3

```
You are informing teams about a delayed product release.

Friction → Original message read like a blame game.  
Bridge → Prompted AI to use calm, empathetic framing with transparent reasoning.  
Evidence → Resulting draft kept facts but removed accusatory tone.  
Implication → Still had vague sections, which you tightened manually.  
Action → Final note used AI’s improved transitions but kept your CTA intact.  
Look Ahead → Shared timeline will be revisited weekly with shared status updates.
```

## 🚧 Where AI Fails in Messaging (Blockers)

| Issue Type             | What It Looks Like                                                  | Fix It With Flavor & Function                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Tone Blindness       | AI-generated output sounds polished but flat or tone-deaf            | Use **Bridge** and **Look Ahead** to humanize and sanity-check tone |
| ❌ Prompt Ambiguity     | Output varies wildly based on minor changes in instruction           | Use **Friction** and **Action** to shape clear prompting paths      |
| ❌ Hidden Assumptions   | AI fills in gaps with wrong or biased assumptions                    | Add **Evidence** step to ground in known truth                      |
| ❌ Hallucinated Help    | AI “adds value” that isn’t fact-checked                              | Implication section must stress human review before trust           |

## ✅ TL;DR

AI isn’t a ghostwriter — it’s a **thinking partner**.  
Used with **Flavor & Function**, it improves clarity without outsourcing responsibility.

Write with it. Think beyond it.  
And always, **edit like it matters.**
