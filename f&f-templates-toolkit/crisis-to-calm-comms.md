# Crisis-to-Calm Communication Using the Flavor & Function Framework  
*Because how you respond matters more than what broke.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

When systems break, silence is noise. Delay becomes doubt.  
This guide helps you translate chaos into **calm, credible communication**, using the Flavor & Function loop to ensure your message reassures, not reacts.

Loop Flow:  
- **Friction** – What’s the real tension here?  
- **Bridge** – What mindset shift will prevent panic or blame?  
- **Evidence** – What’s already known and what’s not?  
- **Implication** – What happens if we say too much, or too little?  
- **Action** – What steps are happening now, and what should the reader do?  
- **Look Ahead** – What’s the expected resolution and how will updates flow?

## 🧰 Template 1: Internal Incident Response Messaging

**Use When:** Communicating about a system outage, bug, or error to internal teams.

```
You are sending an internal update about a tech issue, platform bug, or service delay.

Friction → Teams are confused, customers are impacted.  
Bridge → This is not about blame — it's about visibility and focus.  
Evidence → Provide facts: what is confirmed, what is being investigated.  
Implication → No message = assumptions. Over-explaining = noise.  
Action → Clarify what is being done, by whom, and when next update is due.  
Look Ahead → State resolution path and where updates will appear.
```

---

### ✅ Example 1

```
You are addressing a platform login issue for employees.

Friction → Multiple login failures reported across regions.  
Bridge → Acknowledge the issue — without minimizing impact.  
Evidence → Auth server errors confirmed, root cause under investigation.  
Implication → No further troubleshooting needed by users for now.  
Action → IT is rolling back a recent patch. ETA for fix: 2 hours.  
Look Ahead → Next update at 2 PM in the #it-alerts Slack channel.
```

---

## 🧰 Template 2: External Customer Communication After Incident

**Use When:** You’re notifying customers about an issue that impacts them.

```
You are writing a public note or email regarding a failure, delay, or problem.

Friction → Customers are affected and likely frustrated.  
Bridge → Rebuild trust through transparency, not jargon.  
Evidence → Provide facts: what happened, what’s impacted.  
Implication → Silence = negligence. Clarity = care.  
Action → Share interim guidance (e.g., workaround, alternative).  
Look Ahead → Set expectation for recovery + follow-up.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2

```
You are informing users of a delay in email delivery for transactional messages.

Friction → Delay in password reset and OTP emails.  
Bridge → You're owning the issue with humility and precision.  
Evidence → Email queue backups traced to vendor routing misfire.  
Implication → Reset requests may take 15-20 mins; users retrying multiple times.  
Action → Request users to wait and not submit repeated requests.  
Look Ahead → Fix ETA is 3 hours. Full post-mortem will be published by EOD.
```

## 🧰 Template 3: Leadership Communication During Extended Disruption

**Use When:** A prolonged issue requires executive-level reassurance and vision.

```
You are supporting leadership in drafting a calm, focused note that addresses wider concerns.

Friction → Morale or trust is shaken due to ongoing disruption.  
Bridge → Emotion must be addressed before solutions are accepted.  
Evidence → Name what’s changed, how people are affected.  
Implication → Pretending it’s fine undermines leadership credibility.  
Action → Share not just fixes, but what principles are guiding response.  
Look Ahead → Offer vision of recovery and reinforce team support.
```

---

### ✅ Example 3

```
You are drafting a note for the CEO after a major service incident that made headlines.

Friction → Employees and clients are shaken, media coverage is rising.  
Bridge → Begin with acknowledgement, not avoidance.  
Evidence → “Here’s what we know, and here’s what we’re still learning.”  
Implication → Lack of internal clarity risks gossip, fear, or attrition.  
Action → Outline 3 steps leadership is taking immediately.  
Look Ahead → Invite questions, host live town hall tomorrow, and open async feedback form.
```

## 🚧 Where Crisis Comms Go Wrong (Blockers)

| Issue Type           | What It Looks Like                                                       | Fix It With Flavor & Function                                          |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Delay = Distrust   | Waiting until “we have all the info” to say anything                     | Use **Bridge** and **Evidence** to share what’s known early           |
| ❌ Blame Game         | Messaging sounds defensive or vague ("vendors are fixing it")            | Use **Friction** to own your role, even if indirect                   |
| ❌ Fluff Over Facts   | Using empty statements (“We care deeply…”) without actual detail         | Anchor in **Evidence** and **Action**                                 |
| ❌ Resolution-Free    | No clarity on what happens next                                          | Use **Look Ahead** with timeframes, not just “soon”                   |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

Crisis comms isn’t about sounding calm.  
It’s about **making people feel safe** through clarity, not control.  

Use this framework to guide your next urgent note, and watch what happens:

- Panic slows  
- Trust returns  
- Decisions improve  

And most of all, the **narrative stays in your hands**.
