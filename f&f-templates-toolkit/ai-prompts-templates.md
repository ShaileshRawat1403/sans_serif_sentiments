# AI Prompting Templates Using the Flavor & Function Framework  
*Write prompts that think — not just ask.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This document provides ready-to-use templates and examples for crafting AI prompts using the **Flavor & Function** framework — a writing model that brings clarity, context, and emotional intelligence to any prompt.

All prompts follow the 6-stage loop:

- **Friction** – What's the real tension?
- **Bridge** – What's misunderstood?
- **Evidence** – What backs this up?
- **Implication** – Why does it matter?
- **Action** – What do we want the AI to do?
- **Look Ahead** – What's the reflection or next step?

Use this to design smarter interactions — not just outputs.

## 🧰 Template 1: Mid-Career Reflection Prompt

**Use When:** Helping professionals navigate stagnation, burnout, or re-alignment.

```
You are a [role] helping [audience] explore their current career state.

[Friction] → Many professionals feel...  
[Bridge] → But this isn’t just about [surface reason]...  
[Evidence] → Here’s why this happens...  
[Implication] → If ignored, this can lead to...  
[Action] → Generate a reflection question that...  
[Look Ahead] → End with a nudge toward long-term clarity.
```

---

### ✅ Example 1

```
You are a career coach helping mid-level tech professionals reassess their direction.

Friction → Many feel stuck between ‘too senior to pivot’ and ‘too stagnant to stay’.  
Bridge → It’s not burnout — it’s identity drift.  
Evidence → Research shows career satisfaction dips between years 7–12.  
Implication → Without reevaluation, this dissonance leads to slow disengagement.  
Action → Generate 3 reflection prompts that help them distinguish what energizes vs. drains them.  
Look Ahead → End with a reframe about how they want to be seen 5 years from now.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2

```
You are a transition coach helping first-time managers build confidence.

Friction → Most first-time managers feel overwhelmed by invisible expectations.  
Bridge → It’s not lack of skill — it’s lack of support.  
Evidence → Studies show performance anxiety spikes in the first 90 days.  
Implication → Without emotional safety, they default to task-hoarding or overcompensating.  
Action → Generate a prompt that helps them unpack what confidence means in their role.  
Look Ahead → Close with a reframing question about leading without knowing all the answers.
```

---

### ✅ Example 3

```
You are an AI coach helping solopreneurs delegate their first workflows.

Friction → Many feel they can’t hand off anything without losing control.  
Bridge → It’s not about perfection — it’s about repeatability.  
Evidence → Systems-thinking improves scalability, not just output speed.  
Implication → Without delegation, they hit a ceiling of growth and burnout.  
Action → Generate a system prompt that guides AI to take over repeat tasks.  
Look Ahead → End with a reminder prompt that reflects on value vs. volume.

## 🚧 Common Blockers in AI Prompting (with Real-World Fixes)

| Blocker Area         | What Breaks Down                                                  | Real-World Example + Fix                                                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Friction Missing   | The prompt feels generic; no felt tension or urgency              | “Give productivity tips” → Add: “for marketers juggling 5 tools weekly”     |
| ❌ No Role Framing    | AI replies with bland, context-less output                        | “Write a message” → Fix: “You are a PM writing for legal and finance teams” |
| ❌ Weak Action Format | AI gives wrong format or misaligned length                       | “Share ideas” → Fix: “List 3 bullet ideas in 20 words each with example use”|
| ❌ Look Ahead Absent  | Output ends abruptly; no curiosity or framing for next step       | “Write a lesson summary” → Fix: “End with one reflective follow-up question”|

## ✅ TL;DR (for reuse or summary slides)

Use **Flavor & Function** to guide AI prompts that are:

- Emotionally resonant  
- Structurally reusable  
- Cognitively meaningful  

Use this file to design AI as a co-thinker — not just a search engine.
