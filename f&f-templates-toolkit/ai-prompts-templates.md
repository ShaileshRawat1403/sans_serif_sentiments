Emotionally intelligent

Structurally usable

🧰 Template 1: Mid-Career Reflection Prompt

Use When: Helping professionals navigate stagnation, burnout, or re-alignment.

You are a [role] helping [audience] explore their current career state.

[Friction] → Many professionals feel...  
[Bridge] → But this isn’t just about [surface reason]...  
[Evidence] → Here’s why this happens...  
[Implication] → If ignored, this can lead to...  
[Action] → Generate a reflection question that...  
[Look Ahead] → End with a nudge toward long-term clarity.

✅ Example 1:

You are a career coach helping mid-level tech professionals reassess their direction.

Friction → Many feel stuck between ‘too senior to pivot’ and ‘too stagnant to stay’.  
Bridge → It’s not burnout — it’s identity drift.  
Evidence → Research shows career satisfaction dips between years 7–12.  
Implication → Without reevaluation, this dissonance leads to slow disengagement.  
Action → Generate 3 reflection prompts that help them distinguish what energizes vs. drains them.  
Look Ahead → End with a reframe about how they want to be seen 5 years from now.

✅ Example 2:

You are a transition coach helping first-time managers build confidence.

Friction → Most first-time managers feel overwhelmed by invisible expectations.  
Bridge → It’s not lack of skill — it’s lack of support.  
Evidence → Studies show performance anxiety spikes in the first 90 days.  
Implication → Without emotional safety, they default to task-hoarding or overcompensating.  
Action → Generate a prompt that helps them unpack what confidence means in their role.  
Look Ahead → Close with a reframing question about leading without knowing all the answers.

✅ Example 3:

You are an AI coach helping solopreneurs delegate their first workflows.

Friction → Many feel they can’t hand off anything without losing control.  
Bridge → It’s not about perfection — it’s about repeatability.  
Evidence → Systems-thinking improves scalability, not just output speed.  
Implication → Without delegation, they hit a ceiling of growth and burnout.  
Action → Generate a system prompt that guides AI to take over repeat tasks.  
Look Ahead → End with a reminder prompt that reflects on value vs. volume.

🚧 Common Blockers in AI Prompting (with Real-World Examples)

Blocker Area	What Breaks Down	Real-World Example + Fix

❌ Friction Missing	The prompt feels generic; no felt tension or urgency	“Give productivity tips” → Add: “for marketers juggling 5 tools weekly”
❌ No Role Framing	AI replies with bland, context-less output	“Write a message” → Fix: “You are a PM writing for legal and finance teams”
❌ Weak Action Format	AI gives wrong format or misaligned length	“Share ideas” → Fix: “List 3 bullet ideas in 20 words each with example use”
❌ Look Ahead Absent	Output ends abruptly; no curiosity or framing for next step	“Write a lesson summary” → Fix: “End with one reflective follow-up question”
