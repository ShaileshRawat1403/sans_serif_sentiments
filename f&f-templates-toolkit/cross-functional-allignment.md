# Cross-Functional Alignment Templates Using the Flavor & Function Framework  
*Where collaboration breaks, clarity rebuilds.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

In cross-functional projects, misalignment isn’t rare — it’s the default. These templates help you catch drift, correct course, and build trust without friction.

Use the **Flavor & Function** loop to decode complexity and restore clarity:

- **Friction** – What’s blocking team sync?  
- **Bridge** – What mindset shift is needed?  
- **Evidence** – Where’s the disconnect coming from?  
- **Implication** – What’s the risk of continuing misaligned?  
- **Action** – What should each function/team do next?  
- **Look Ahead** – What will good alignment *look like*?

## 🧰 Template 1: Alignment Kickoff Between Teams

**Use When:** Two or more functions are beginning to collaborate and need shared context.

```
You are writing a kickoff note or summary to align Product + Marketing (or similar) functions.

Friction → Each team has different timelines, goals, or expectations.  
Bridge → This isn’t a conflict — it's a clarity gap.  
Evidence → Previous projects showed slow handoffs or missed deadlines.  
Implication → Without sync, delivery slips and customer experience suffers.  
Action → Share the shared roadmap, clarify owners, and agree on comms rhythm.  
Look Ahead → Highlight what success looks like, and how alignment will be revisited.
```

---

### ✅ Example 1

```
You are aligning Product and Support on a feature launch timeline.

Friction → Support has been looped in late during past rollouts.  
Bridge → This isn’t about ownership — it’s about timing and impact.  
Evidence → Last quarter, 40% of inbound tickets came from lack of internal clarity.  
Implication → If repeated, NPS and trust take a hit before the product even scales.  
Action → From now, product briefs will be shared 2 weeks ahead, with test access.  
Look Ahead → Joint retro planned post-launch to improve future sync.
```

## 🧰 Template 2: Mid-Project Course Correction

**Use When:** There’s growing misalignment mid-way through a project or sprint.

```
You are addressing scope, clarity, or role drift between cross-functional contributors.

Friction → Tasks or priorities have diverged across [teams/functions].  
Bridge → This isn’t misbehavior — it’s entropy without reinforcement.  
Evidence → Task overlaps, missed reviews, or conflicting OKRs are visible.  
Implication → Continued misalignment delays delivery and drains morale.  
Action → Reset roles, reclarify owner-docs, share updated scope.  
Look Ahead → Share how progress will now be tracked and reviewed.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2

```
You are aligning Design, Engineering, and Legal after confusion over approval flows.

Friction → Multiple teams are stuck waiting on others for review sign-offs.  
Bridge → This isn’t incompetence — it’s system lag and role fuzziness.  
Evidence → The new compliance banner went live with wrong disclaimers due to confusion.  
Implication → Legal liability and trust erosion is now a real risk.  
Action → A new RACI chart is live in Notion. All reviews go through that flow.  
Look Ahead → Biweekly checkpoints now include dependency watch + open loops dashboard.
```

## 🧰 Template 3: Pre-Mortem Communication for High-Stakes Deliverables

**Use When:** You’re anticipating issues before a major launch, event, or change.

```
You are sending a message that pre-aligns teams ahead of launch to minimize last-minute surprises.

Friction → In past launches, last-minute blockers derailed momentum.  
Bridge → This isn’t to create paranoia — it’s to build shared foresight.  
Evidence → Each team has seen past last-mile misfires due to unchecked assumptions.  
Implication → With no prep, postmortems become fire drills.  
Action → Share checklist, blockers doc, and request pre-launch risk flags.  
Look Ahead → Set shared cadence for daily check-ins or launch huddles.
```

---

### ✅ Example 3

```
You are prepping Content, Sales, and Product Marketing for a new GTM launch.

Friction → Launches have previously shipped without updated decks or enablement docs.  
Bridge → This isn’t just a content problem — it’s timing + sign-off discipline.  
Evidence → 2 out of 3 launches last quarter had missing material at go-live.  
Implication → Sales teams enter convos underprepared, which reduces lead conversion.  
Action → Launch checklist due EOD Wednesday. PMM team owns asset handoff.  
Look Ahead → Final asset review + dry run call on Friday, then go-live Monday.
```

## 🚧 Common Misfires in Cross-Functional Comms

| Issue Type         | What It Looks Like                                                     | Fix It With Flavor & Function                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Function Bias    | One team’s lens dominates the message                                  | Use **Bridge** to acknowledge all perspectives equally               |
| ❌ No Shared Rhythm | Different update cycles and silence between milestones                 | Use **Look Ahead** to set check-ins or mutual syncs                  |
| ❌ Owner Drift      | Confused accountability as team size grows                             | Add clear **Action** → who does what and by when                    |
| ❌ Feedback Silos   | Feedback shared too late or in private DMs                             | Use **Evidence** and shared tools to surface early misunderstandings |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

Use these templates to:

- Turn parallel work into coordinated flow  
- Diagnose team drift before it becomes delivery debt  
- Build communication rituals that scale across functions  

Cross-functional doesn’t mean cross-purpose — with the right loop.
