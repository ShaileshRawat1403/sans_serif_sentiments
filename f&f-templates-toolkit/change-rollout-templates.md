# Change Rollout Templates Using the Flavor & Function Framework  
*Change isn't just announced. It's translated.*

---

## 📌 Purpose

When organizations roll out new tools, processes, or structures — confusion is a given. These templates help you communicate change with structure, clarity, and emotional intelligence.

Built on the **Flavor & Function** loop:

- **Friction** – What tension or uncertainty does this change trigger?  
- **Bridge** – What belief or misconception needs reframing?  
- **Evidence** – What supports this direction or decision?  
- **Implication** – What happens if this isn’t understood or adopted?  
- **Action** – What should teams actually do or start changing?  
- **Look Ahead** – What clarity or reassurance can we offer for the future?

## 🧰 Template 1: Announcing a Tool Migration

**Use When:** Communicating the replacement or migration of a tool or system.

```
You are writing a change communication about migrating from [Tool A] to [Tool B].

Friction → This shift may feel disruptive to current team workflows.  
Bridge → It’s not just about switching tools — it's about aligning to future needs.  
Evidence → Tool B reduces [manual effort/delay/cost] by [quantified reason].  
Implication → Staying on Tool A causes [compliance risks/data gaps/support issues].  
Action → Outline the migration timeline + key user actions (e.g. sign-up, export).  
Look Ahead → Reinforce what improvements teams will notice post-migration.
```

---

### ✅ Example 1

```
You are writing about shifting from Trello to Jira for task management.

Friction → Some teams have deeply embedded workflows in Trello.  
Bridge → This isn’t about change for the sake of it — it’s about unifying tracking.  
Evidence → Jira gives better sprint planning, audit logs, and integration with dev tools.  
Implication → Without this, we continue to miss dependencies across squads.  
Action → Migration starts August 1. Project leads must move boards by July 30.  
Look Ahead → Post-migration, all product teams will have a single source of task truth.
```

---

## 🧰 Template 2: Culture or Workflow Shift (Behavioral)

**Use When:** Communicating change in team rituals, workflows, or culture.

```
You are leading a change in how teams collaborate, communicate, or prioritize.

Friction → It may feel like this change complicates the current routine.  
Bridge → But this shift isn’t about more process — it’s about reducing misalignment.  
Evidence → Repeated blockers show miscommunication across roles/tools/silos.  
Implication → If not addressed, it leads to burnout, repeat work, or delivery risk.  
Action → Share new rituals, tools, or behavior expectations.  
Look Ahead → Explain how the first 30/60 days will be supported or evaluated.
```

---

### ✅ Example 2

```
You are rolling out weekly async updates instead of live stand-ups.

Friction → Some team members feel async updates lose visibility or connection.  
Bridge → But async isn’t silence — it’s structured, scalable transparency.  
Evidence → Live stand-ups were taking 4+ hrs/week across time zones with low ROI.  
Implication → Without change, team flow is interrupted, and context-switching increases.  
Action → All teams to post weekly update cards by Friday EOD. Use template (linked).  
Look Ahead → We’ll review impact in 30 days with opt-in feedback channels.
```

---

## 🧰 Template 3: Addressing Change Resistance

**Use When:** You’ve already announced a change, but teams are hesitant or pushing back.

```
You are addressing quiet resistance or voiced hesitation around a recent change.

Friction → We’ve heard concerns about [change area or side-effect].  
Bridge → The hesitation is valid — this isn’t about denying impact.  
Evidence → Here’s what was observed and what’s being adjusted.  
Implication → Without adapting, we risk adoption failure or morale loss.  
Action → Clarify what will change based on feedback and where alignment is still critical.  
Look Ahead → Share how feedback will remain open and when the next review is.
```

---

### ✅ Example 3

```
You are following up after backlash around a meeting-free Wednesdays rollout.

Friction → Some felt the change was symbolic but not enforced team-wide.  
Bridge → This isn’t about false promises — it’s about fixing the enforcement gap.  
Evidence → 30% of teams still booked meetings on Wednesdays last month.  
Implication → Without clarity, this initiative breeds skepticism instead of relief.  
Action → From next week, leaders will block out Wednesdays org-wide. Escalation steps defined.  
Look Ahead → Re-assessing adoption after 45 days with anonymous feedback loop.
```

## 🚧 Common Communication Frictions in Change Rollouts

| Issue Type           | What It Looks Like                                                 | Fix It With Flavor & Function                                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ Over-Explaining   | Feels defensive, loses clarity                                     | Focus **Bridge** on belief shift, not justification                      |
| ❌ Vague Action       | Teams unsure what to actually do next                              | Use **Action** with checklist, timelines, or linked steps                |
| ❌ Assumed Agreement | Teams “nod” but don’t change behaviors                             | Highlight **Friction** and **Implication** clearly                       |
| ❌ No Follow-Through | Initial push made, but no updates or next steps shared             | Use **Look Ahead** with review cadence, checkpoints, or success signals |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

Use these templates to:

- Announce change with empathy and systems-thinking  
- Shift behaviors without triggering fear or silence  
- Make teams feel seen, guided, and supported  

Change that lands is change that’s translated — not just sent.
